PROMPT FOR LLM

You are a senior backend/cloud engineer.

Your task is to implement the following assignment exactly as specified — no more, no less.

Core Rules (do not violate)

Backend language: Python only

Keep everything as simple as possible

If a feature is not explicitly required — DO NOT implement it

No premature abstractions

No microservices unless required

No UI frameworks unless necessary

Minimal architecture that still satisfies all functional and non-functional requirements

Readable, boring, obvious code is preferred

Avoid cleverness

Avoid “best practices” unless required by the task

Focus on passing requirements and test scenarios

Functional Goal

Build a web application “Lecture Notes Generator” that:

Accepts a lecture title and a public Yandex Disk video link

Queues tasks

Asynchronously:

Validates Yandex Disk link

Downloads video

Extracts audio

Converts speech to text

Generates a summary

Produces a PDF

Stores the PDF in Object Storage

Shows a single page with all tasks and their statuses

Allows downloading the PDF when ready

Infrastructure Requirements

You must deploy everything using Terraform to Yandex Cloud.

Allowed services ONLY:

Yandex API Gateway

Yandex Object Storage

Yandex VPC

Yandex Managed Service for YDB

Yandex Message Queue

Yandex Container Registry

Yandex Serverless Containers

Yandex Cloud Functions

Yandex Lockbox

Yandex IAM

Yandex Resource Manager

Yandex SpeechKit

YandexGPT API

❌ Do NOT use anything else
❌ Do NOT introduce external SaaS

Architecture Constraints (keep minimal)

One simple Python web backend

One background worker

One queue

One database

One bucket

No real-time updates (page refresh only)

No auth

No user accounts

All users share one global queue

Terraform Requirements (mandatory)

Use variables:

cloud_id

folder_id

prefix

All resources must be named as:

<prefix>-<resource-name>


No secrets in .tf files

Use environment variable:

YC_TOKEN


Terraform output must hide sensitive values

Terraform must:

Deploy

Initialize

Destroy cleanly

Application Requirements
Backend

Python

Minimal dependencies

Simple routing

HTML can be basic (no frontend frameworks required)

Asynchronous processing via queue

Store task state in YDB

Task Statuses

QUEUED

PROCESSING

DONE

ERROR

Temporary Files

Auto-delete after ~1 hour (best-effort is acceptable)

What Must Be Implemented (and nothing else)

Web form:

Lecture title (required)

Yandex Disk public video link (required)

Task list page:

Sorted newest → oldest

Shows:

created_at

id

title

video link

status

error message (if any)

download link (only if DONE)

Background processing

PDF generation with lecture title inside

Object Storage private bucket

HTTPS access

What Is Explicitly NOT Required (do not add)

User authentication

Authorization

Styling/UI polish

Pagination

Search

WebSockets

Retries beyond basic error handling

Rate limiting

Monitoring dashboards

CI/CD

Tests (manual scenarios only)

Deliverables You Must Produce

Git repository structure

Python backend source code

Terraform configuration

Dockerfile (only if needed)

README.md with:

Architecture explanation

How to deploy using Terraform

List of used Yandex Cloud services

Exact commands to:

terraform apply

test manually

terraform destroy

Important Notes

Assume:

export YC_TOKEN=...


Assume terraform and yc CLI are available

Cloud ID and Folder ID are provided via variables

Prioritize working simplicity over elegance

If something is ambiguous, choose the simplest valid interpretation

Final Instruction

Do not explain alternatives.
Do not justify design decisions unless strictly necessary.
Just build the minimal working solution that satisfies the assignment and test cases.
